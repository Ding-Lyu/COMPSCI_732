<b>What we have</b>

As we described in the proposal. we are aiming to developing a video streaming service interface.  Our design should have the following features. 

Must-have	1.      Login/logout features	17/4/2021
	        2.	Menu bar/search bar	17/4/2021
	        3.	google/videos API	24/4/2021

Should-have	1.	favourites	1/5/2021
	        2.	comments	5/5/2021

In fact, we developed accordance with the requirements in our plan. But we are facing the issue of copyright of film and television resources, so in the end our project pays more attention to the interaction of users' comments instead of movie resources. This project is divided into three main functions. 

The first part: After finished the register from users can log in and add their favorite movies to the his Watchlist.  

The second part:  users can comment on the movie. 

The third part: users are able to search to see what movies are available

<b>Weekly regular meeting notes:</b>

We have regular meeting weekly during period between April 10th and May 9th.

- April 10th - 16th:
In this week, we have discussed the assignments for each members. Each member would have started their coding and push to github based on their assignments. For the large structrues, Eric is responsible for frontend and Ding is responsible for backend. Yimeng and Ming would need to be responsible for debugging and designing the UI of the website. 

- April 17th - 25th:
After a week, each member have started their own assigned tasks. In this week, Eric has built the basic structure of the website with home page, movie page and series page. Ming and Yimeng have started do some research of the video interface webside along the internet and gather the idea of making the website more user interactive. Ding have done some research for building database to the video website. 

- April 26th - May 2nd:
In this week, both frontend and backend have been built and we meet some problems of the copyright of film resources. In this meeting we discuss about how to fix the problem and we end up changing our plan and would do more about user interation such as comments. Adding comments is our should-have feature which is also our backup plan. 

- May 3rd - May 9th:
Our project have come to the end. We have a meeting to discuss merging our source code together and push to main branch in github. 


The version in main does not include the search bar function, and the latest version has not been tested due to time issues, so we cannot take a risk of having bug by merging it into main. We recommend downloading and viewing our latest version in ENYULIU Brunch
