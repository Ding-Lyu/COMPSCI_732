What we have
As we described in the proposal. we are aiming to developing a video streaming service interface.  Our design should have the following features. 

Must-have	1.	Login/logout features	17/4/2021
	        2.	Menu bar/search bar	17/4/2021
	        3.	google/videos API	24/4/2021

Should-have	1.	favourites	1/5/2021
	        2.	comments	5/5/2021

In fact, we developed accordance with the requirements in our plan. But we are facing the issue of copyright of film and television resources, so in the end our project pays more attention to the interaction of users' comments instead of movie resources. This project is divided into three main functions. 

The first part: After finished the register from users can log in and add their favorite movies to the his Watchlist.  

The second part:  users can comment on the movie. 

The third part: users are able to search to see what movies are available
